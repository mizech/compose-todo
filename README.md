# To-Do List

Simple Android to-do list-app, done with Jetpack Compose and Room persistence library.

## Usage

Within the All To-Dos activity: Create a to-do by providing a title. Then press the Insert-Button. You can change the is-done flag of a to-do by swiping from right to left.

Within the details activity: You can provide an optional note and toggle the high-importance flag. You can toggle the is-done flag. Remove the to-do by pressing the trash bin-icon.

- To-Dos with the is-done flag not set get a yellow border.
- To-Dos with the high-importance flag get a red border. They become ordered to the top of the list.
- To-Dos with the is-done flag set get a green border. They become ordered to the bottom of the list.

Click on the trash bin-icon removes all to-dos with the is-done flag set. Click on the exclamation mark-icon empties the list.
